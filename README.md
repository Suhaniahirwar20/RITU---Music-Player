# RITU---Music-Player
My code appears to be implementing a basic music player using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The code appears to be for a simple web-based music player named "RITU." It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide functionality like play/pause, seek bar, and song navigation.

<br>
HTML:

The structure includes a navigation bar, a container for displaying songs, and a bottom control bar for playback controls.
A list of songs is dynamically populated based on an array of song objects.

<br>
CSS:

Styles for the player include a dark theme with light text, a sticky bottom bar, and song items with a vibrant background.

<br>
JavaScript:

Provides functionality for:
Initializing and playing audio files.
Updating and syncing the progress bar with the audio timeline.
Switching between songs using the previous and next buttons.
Individual play buttons for each song in the list.
